# Gradienting-Functional-Anatomy
High-resolution Functional Anatomy of the Human Brain at Rest

The brain possesses distinct cytoarchitectonics. This amazing beauty of cytoarchitectonics has been observed and illustrated by drawing on the paper up-to-the high-precision histological mapping.

This project aims to ask, what are the underline intrinsic functional organizations within distinct cytoarchitectonic components of the Human Brain.

The functional anatomy analysis is being performed in a sample of 62 healthy subjects (genetically unrelated)in a high-resolution 7T HCP set using a sensitive and reliable Functional signal analysis approach (reference below).

The analysis in the flow: As the new brain area calculations finish, I will update, so bookmark and visit again and again!
